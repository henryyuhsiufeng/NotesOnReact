# NotesOnReact
## my-app
"my-app" contains an example React.js application that simulates a todolist

I am using Traversy Media and documentation for my learning of React.js. In Traversy Media's code along, I had to go off course a bit to get the example application to work. 

### intro
- What is React?

### chOne
- Brief summary of React States
- Using create-react-app to create starter react application build
- Summary of lifecycle methods
- Developer tools

### Extra
- Installed uuid to generate new id's when a new todo is created. 
- Uses jsonPlaceholder api to fill in the todo list.
